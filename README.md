# IoT-Advanced-Level-Project-2024-25-Even-Sem
This IoT project utilizes a NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller and the Blynk app to create a comprehensive home automation system. It integrates sensors such as DHT11 for temperature and humidity, MQ2 for gas detection, an ultrasonic sensor for water level measurement, a PIR sensor for motion detection, and a flame sensor for fire alerts.
